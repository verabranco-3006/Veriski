## Key Files to Always Reference

When helping me, always read these files first:

1. **memory.md** — My patterns, strengths, growth edges, and accumulated insights
2. **writing_style.md** — How I write (CRITICAL for any drafting tasks)
3. **goals/90_day.md** — Current quarter priorities
4. **teams/health_tracker.md** — Team health overview
5. **initiatives/_dashboard.md** — What I'm working on
6. **inbox.md** — Quick capture for tasks and ideas

|-------|---------|--------------|
| Weekly Checkpoint | `/weekly-checkpoint` | Weekly review against 90-day goals, creates `log/weekly/YYYY-Www/` |
| Monthly Checkpoint | `/monthly-checkpoint` | Monthly review bridging weekly insights and quarterly goals, creates `log/monthly/YYYY-MM.md` |
| Quarterly Checkpoint | `/quarterly-checkpoint` | Quarter review with goal progress, patterns, memory.md updates |

| Weekly reviews    | YYYY-Www.md            | 2026-W02.md    |
| Monthly summaries | YYYY-MM.md             | 2026-01.md     |
| Quarterly reviews | YYYY-Qn.md             | 2026-Q1.md     |

| ----------- | ------------------ |
| `- [ ]`     | Task / action item |
| `- [x]`     | Completed task     |
| `- [w]`     | Win to remember    |

## When Helping Me...

**DO:**
- Reference memory.md for my patterns and context
- **Read writing_style.md BEFORE any drafting task or write any text to pages/files** — match my voice exactly
- Be direct and concise — I prefer clarity over softness
- Call out when I'm repeating past mistakes (check memory.md)
- Suggest connections between current situation and past insights
- Use executive-level language, not therapy-speak
- When drafting: shorter is better, avoid AI-sounding phrases

**DON'T:**
- Add productivity theater or unnecessary structure
- Be overly positive — I want honest assessment
- Forget to reference my 90-day goals for context
- Create new files without checking if similar exists
- Use words from my "avoid" list in writing_style.md
- Sound like ChatGPT default output (too polished, too many transitions)
- Add pleasantries or filler phrases I wouldn't use

---

## My Preferences

- **Tone:** Calm, direct, executive-level
- **Format:** Minimal formatting, no excessive headers or bullets
- **Reviews:** I do daily (5min), weekly (15min), monthly (20min), quarterly (60min)
- **Energy:** Track patterns to optimize my schedule

---

## Shared Folders

The `initiatives/` folder is a **Windows directory junction** pointing to `ProcessEngineering_Internal/initiatives/`. This means:

- **initiatives/ is shared with the team** — any edits here are immediately visible in the team repo
- **Git tracking happens in ProcessEngineering_Internal**, not Veriski (initiatives/ is in Veriski's .gitignore)
- **When committing initiative changes**, commit in ProcessEngineering_Internal, not Veriski
- **During daily wrap-up**, commit and push both repos: Veriski (private content) and ProcessEngineering_Internal (initiative content)
- **Team members edit initiatives directly** in ProcessEngineering_Internal — no dependency on Vera

**What stays private in Veriski:** meetings/prep, meetings/raw, people/, memory.md, log/, goals/, private-initiatives/
**What is shared via junction:** initiatives/ (dashboard, active initiatives, completed initiatives)

### Private Initiatives

`private-initiatives/` follows the same structure as `initiatives/` but is tracked only in Veriski. Use for team management, coaching plans, performance-related work, or anything sensitive that shouldn't be visible to the team.

## Integration Notes

This system lives in Obsidian and is accessed by Claude Code.

**Obsidian plugins in use:**
- Dataview (for queries)
- Templater (for templates)
- Periodic Notes (for daily/weekly/monthly)
- Tasks (for action tracking)

**When creating Dataview queries:**
```dataview
LIST
FROM "log/daily"
WHERE file.cday >= date(today) - dur(7 days)
SORT file.cday DESC
```
